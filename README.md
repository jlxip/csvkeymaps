# csvkeymaps
These are the keymaps from [kbd](https://kbd-project.org) converted to CSV using [kbd2csv](https://github.com/jlxip/kbd2csv).
Please read the README of the latter before using these files.

A `xz`-compressed archive is available in [the releases](TODO) ([direct link]()].
Feel free to include it as-is on your project or use only a few of the keymaps.

While this script is public domain, the keymaps appear to be GNU GPL 2.
Consider referencing both projects (kbd and kbd2csv) if you end up using these files.

That's it, have fun!
